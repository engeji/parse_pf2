Investing Magic Items
--------------------------

Certain magic items convey their magical benefits only
when worn and invested using the Invest an Item activity,
tying them to your inner potential. These items have the
invested trait. Many invested items have constant abilities
that function all the time or that always trigger when you
use the item—but only when they’re invested. If you don’t
have an item invested, these abilities don’t work. If an
invested item can be activated, you must have invested
the item to activate it.

You can benefit from no more than 10 invested magic
items each day. Because this limit is fairly high, and because
it matters only for worn items, you probably won’t need
to worry about reaching the limit until higher levels, when
you’ve acquired many useful magic items to wear.
You can still gain the mundane benefits of an item if you
don’t invest it. A suit of +1 resilient armor still gives you
its item bonus to AC when not invested, but it doesn’t give
its magical bonus to saving throws, and winged boots still
protect your feet even though you can’t activate them to
fly. Entirely non-magical items don’t need to be invested.

.. rst-class:: description

Invest An Item
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You invest your energy in an item with the invested trait as
you don it. This process requires 1 or more Interact actions,
usually taking the same amount of time it takes to don the item.
Once you’ve Invested the Item, you benefit from its constant
magical abilities as long as you meet its other requirements
(for most invested items, the only other requirement is that
you must be wearing the item). This investiture lasts until you
remove the item.

You can invest no more than 10 items per day. If you remove
an invested item, it loses its investiture. The item still counts
against your daily limit after it loses its investiture. You reset
the limit during your daily preparations, at which point you
Invest your Items anew. If you’re still wearing items you had
invested the previous day, you can typically keep them invested
on the new day, but they still count against your limit.


< ... >



Activating Items
--------------------------

Some items produce their effects only when used properly
in the moment. Others always offer the same benefits as
their mundane counterparts when worn, but have magical
abilities you can gain by further spending actions. Either
case requires you to use the Activate an Item activity.
Activating an Item works much like Casting a Spell, in that
the activity takes a variable number of actions and can have
different components depending on how you Activate the
Item. This information appears in the item’s Activate entry.

If an item is used up when activated, as is the case for
consumable items, its Activate entry appears toward the
top of the stat block. For permanent items with activated
abilities, the Activate entry is a paragraph in the description.
Activations are not necessarily magical—for instance,
drinking an alchemical elixir isn’t usually a magical effect.

.. rst-class:: description

Activate An Item
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Requirement** You can Activate an Item with the invested
trait only if it’s invested by you. If the item requires you to
Interact with it, you must be wielding it (if it’s a held item)
or touching it with a free hand (if it’s another type of item).

-----------------

You call forth the effect of an item by properly activating
it. This is a special activity that takes a variable number of
actions, as listed in the item’s stat block.
Some items can be activated as a reaction or free action. In
this case, you Activate the Item as a reaction or free action (as
appropriate) instead of as an activity. Such cases are noted
in the item’s Activate entry in its stat block—for example,
**“Activate** |д-р| command.”

**Long Activation Times** Some items take minutes or hours
to activate. The Activate an Item activity for these items
includes a mix of the listed activation components, but it’s not
necessary to break down which one you’re providing at a given
time. You can’t use other actions or reactions while activating
such an item, though at the GM’s discretion, you might be able
to speak a few sentences. As with other activities that take
a long time, these activations have the exploration trait, and
you can’t activate them in an encounter. If combat breaks out
while you’re activating one, your activation is disrupted (see
the Disrupting Activations sidebar).

**Activation Components** Each activation entry lists any
components involved in the activation after the action icons
or text, such as “|д-1| command.” The activation components,
described below, add traits (listed in parentheses) and
requirements to the activation. If you can’t provide the
components, you fail to Activate the Item.

* Command (auditory, concentrate)
* Envision (concentrate)
* Interact (manipulate)
* Cast a Spell


Activation Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An item’s activate entry lists the components required to
activate its abilities. Each component adds certain traits
to the Activate an Item activity, and some components
have special requirements. The components that appear
in this book are listed below.

Command
""""""""""""""""""""

This component is a specific utterance you must make
in a loud and strong voice. Activate an Item gains the
auditory and concentrate traits. You must be able to speak
to provide this component.

Envision
""""""""""""""""""""

This component is a specific image or phenomenon you
need to imagine. Activate an Item gains the concentrate trait.

< ... >


Sustaining Activations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some items, once activated, have effects that can be
sustained if you concentrate on them. This works much
like the Sustain a Spell action (found on page 304). If an
item’s description states that you can sustain the effect, that
effect lasts until the end of your turn in the round after you
Activated the Item. You can use a Sustain an Activation
action on that turn to extend the duration.


.. rst-class:: description

|д-1| Sustain An Activation
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Concentrate

**Requirements** You have at least one magic item activation that
you can sustain, and you are not fatigued.

-----------------------

Choose one magic item activation with a sustained duration
you have in effect. The duration of that activation continues
until the end of your next turn. Some activations may have
slightly different or expanded effects if you sustain them.
Sustaining an Activation for more than 10 minutes (100
rounds) ends the activation and makes you fatigued unless
the item’s description states a different maximum duration
(such as “up to 1 minute” or “up to 1 hour”).

If your Sustain an Activation action is disrupted, the item’s
effect immediately ends.


Dismissing Activations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some item effects can be dismissed, ending the duration
early due to you or the target taking action. Dismissing
an activation requires using the Dismiss action.

.. rst-class:: description

|д-1| Dismiss
"""""""""""""""

- Concentrate

You end one spell effect or magic item effect. This must be an
effect that you are allowed to dismiss, as defined by the spell
or item. Dismissal might end the effect entirely, or might end
it just for a certain target or targets, depending on the spell
or item.


Reading Items
---------------------------

Hundreds of items lie ahead. Each item is presented in a
stat block, much like spells or feats. The example below
shows the structure of an item stat block and gives a
brief description of each entry. Entries appear only when
applicable, so not all items will have every entry described
here. Detailed rules governing aspects of the stat block
specific to items appear after the stat block.


.. rst-class:: description

Item Name / Item [level]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Traits

**Price** This entry lists the item’s Price. An item that has multiple
types includes Price for each type in its entry.

**Ammunition** Magic ammunition lists the types of ammunition
available for that kind of item.

**Usage** This entry describes whether the item is held, worn, or
affixed to or etched onto another item; **Bulk** The item’s Bulk
is listed here (the rules for Bulk appear on page 271). Runes
don’t have a Bulk entry.

**Activate** The number of actions needed to Activate the Item
appear here, followed by the components in parentheses.
You can find activation rules on page 532. This entry
appears here for consumables and lower in the stat block
for permanent items that can be activated. This section
might also have Frequency, Trigger, or Requirements
entries as necessary.

**Onset** This entry appears if the item’s effect is delayed, which
most often occurs with alchemical poisons. The onset is
the amount of time that elapses between when a character
Activates an Item and any effect occurs.

---------------

The section after the line describes the item and its constant
abilities. If the item can be activated and doesn’t have an
Activate entry above, that entry appears here in a paragraph
beginning with “Activate.”

---------------

**Type** If multiple types of the item exist, entries here indicate
the name of each type, its level, its Price, and any other
relevant details or alterations from the above description.

---------------

**Craft Requirements** An item that has special requirements to
be Crafted details those requirements here.




Level
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An item’s level indicates what level of adventurer the item
is best suited for. There’s no limit to the items a character
can use, though. A 3rd-level character who finds an
item of 4th level or higher while adventuring can use it
normally. Likewise, they can purchase the item if they can
find it for sale and can afford it.

When making items, a character’s level must be equal
to or higher than the item’s level in order to Craft it. In
addition to anything listed in the Craft Requirements
entry in the item’s stat block, the crafter must have the
appropriate skill proficiencies and feats, as well as the
item’s formula; see the Craft activity on page 244 for
more information about these requirements.

Multiple Types
"""""""""""""""""""""

If multiple types of an item exist, the title line gives the
minimum level followed by a plus symbol (“+”). The
description includes information on the base version of the
item, and the Type entries at the bottom of the stat block
lists the specifics for each version, including the level, Price,
and any modified or added abilities of the different types.
For some items, the types listed are upgrades to the base
item. For other items, such as aeon stones and wondrous
figurines, each type is distinct from the others.




< ... >




Alchemical Items
----------------------------------

Alchemical items are not magical. They instead use the
properties of volatile chemicals, exotic minerals, potent
plants, and other substances, collectively referred to as
alchemical reagents. As such, alchemical items don’t
radiate magical auras, and they can’t be dismissed
or affected by dispel magic. Their effects last for a set
amount of time or until they are countered in some way,
typically physically.

Sometimes the reactions of alchemical reagents create
effects that seem magical, and at other times they straddle
the line between purely reactive and the inexplicable.
Alchemists can infuse reagents with some of their own
essence, allowing them to efficiently create short-lived
alchemical items at no monetary cost. Even in these cases,
alchemical items don’t radiate magic auras, instead using
the alchemist’s infused essence as one additional catalyst
for the item’s alchemical effects.

< ... >


.. rst-class:: craft-treasure-bombs

Alchemical Bombs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An alchemical bomb combines volatile alchemical
components that explode when the bomb hits a creature
or object. Most alchemical bombs deal damage, though
some produce other effects. Bombs have the bomb trait.

Bombs are martial thrown weapons with a range
increment of 20 feet. When you throw a bomb, you
make a weapon attack roll against the target’s AC, as
you would for any other weapon. It takes one hand to
draw, prepare, and throw a bomb. Due to the complexity
involved in preparing bombs, Strikes to throw alchemical
bombs gain the manipulate trait. The bomb is activated
when thrown as a Strike—you don’t have to activate
it separately.

Splash Trait
""""""""""""""""""""

Most bombs also have the splash trait. When you use a
thrown weapon with the splash trait, you don’t add your
Strength modifier to the damage roll. If an attack with a
splash weapon fails, succeeds, or critically succeeds, all
creatures within 5 feet of the target (including the target)
take the listed splash damage. On a failure (but not a critical
failure), the target of the attack still takes the splash damage.
Add splash damage together with the initial damage against
the target before applying the target’s resistance or weakness.
You don’t multiply splash damage on a critical hit.

For example, if you threw a lesser acid flask and hit
your target, that creature would take 1d6 persistent acid
damage and 1 acid splash damage. All other creatures
within 5 feet of it would take 1 acid splash damage. On
a critical hit, the target would take 2d6 persistent acid
damage, but the splash damage would still be 1. If you
missed, the target would take 1 splash damage. If you
critically failed, no one would take any damage.

.. rst-class:: craft-treasure-armor

Armor
---------------------------------------------

Suits of armor can be crafted from precious materials or
infused with magic to grant them abilities exceeding those
of typical armor. Many suits of magic armor are created
by etching runes onto them, as described on page 580.
The magic armor stat block lists the Price and
attributes of the most common armors you can
make with fundamental runes. Other special
suits of armor might be made of precious
materials, and some are specially crafted
items all on their own.


Precious Material Armor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suits of armor made of precious
materials are more expensive and
sometimes grant special effects.
You can make leather armor
out of dragonhide, wooden
armor out of darkwood, and metal armor
out of any precious materials except for
darkwood. Because armor’s Bulk is
reduced when the armor is worn, use
its carried Bulk when determining
its material Price. (Materials are on
page 577.)



Adamantine Armor / Item 12+
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- :uncommon:`Uncommon`

**Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** varies by armor

----------------

Adamantine armor has a shiny, black appearance and is
amazingly durable.

----------------

**Type** standard-grade adamantine armor; **Level** 12; **Price** 1,600
gp + 160 gp per Bulk; **Craft Requirements** The initial raw
materials must include adamantine worth at least 200 gp
+ 20 gp per Bulk.

----------------

**Type** high-grade adamantine armor; **Level** 19; **Price**
32,000 gp + 3,200 gp per Bulk; Craft Requirements The
initial raw materials must include adamantine worth at
least 16,000 gp + 1,600 gp per Bulk.



Cold Iron Armor / Item 5+
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

**Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** varies by armor

----------------

Cold iron armor sickens certain creatures that touch it. A
creature with weakness to cold iron (such as most demons
and fey) that critically fails an unarmed attack against a
creature in cold iron armor becomes sickened 1. A creature
with weakness to cold iron is sickened 1 as long as it wears
cold iron armor.

----------------

**Type** low-grade cold iron armor; **Level** 5; **Price** 140 gp + 14 gp
per Bulk; **Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must
include cold iron worth at least 70 sp + 7 sp per Bulk

+ 2,000 gp per Bulk; **Craft Requirements** The initial raw
materials must include cold iron worth at least 10,000 gp
+ 1,000 gp per Bulk.




< ... >




Basic Magic Armor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most common special armors are suits of armor with
some combination of armor potency and resilient runes.
The following stat block provides a quick reference for
these types of armor.



Magic Armor / Item 5+
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Abjuration
- Invested
- Magical

**Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** varies by armor

----------------

A suit of magic armor is simply a suit of
armor or explorer’s clothing etched with
fundamental runes. An armor potency
rune increases the armor’s item bonus
to AC, and a resilient rune adds an item
bonus to saving throws.

The Prices here are for all types of armor.
You don’t need to adjust the Price from leather
armor to full plate or the like. These armors
are made of standard materials, not precious
materials such as mithral.

----------------

**Type** *+1 armor*; **Level** 5; **Price** 160 gp
This armor has a +1 armor potency rune (increase the
item bonus to AC by 1).

----------------

**Type** *+1 resilient armor*; **Level** 8; **Price** 500 gp
This armor has a +1 armor potency rune (increase the item
bonus to AC by 1) and a resilient rune (+1 item bonus to saves).

----------------

**Type** *+2 resilient armor*; **Level** 11; **Price** 1,400 gp
This armor has a +2 armor potency rune (increase the
item bonus to AC by 2) and a resilient rune (+1 item bonus
to saves).

----------------

**Type** *+2 greater resilient armor*; **Level** 14; **Price** 4,500 gp
This armor has a +2 armor potency rune (increase the item
bonus to AC by 2) and a greater resilient rune (+2 item bonus
to saves).

----------------

**Type** *+3 greater resilient armor*; **Level** 18; **Price** 24,000 gp
This armor has a +3 armor potency rune (increase the item
bonus to AC by 3) and a greater resilient rune (+2 item bonus
to saves).

----------------

**Type** *+3 major resilient armor*; **Level** 20; **Price** 70,000 gp
This armor has a +3 armor potency rune (increase the item
bonus to AC by 3) and a major resilient rune (+3 item bonus
to saves).





< ... >







Consumables
---------------------------------------------

This section includes magic items with the consumable
trait. An item with this trait can be used only once. Unless
stated otherwise, it is destroyed after activation. When
a character creates consumable items, they can make
them in batches of four, as described in the Craft activity.

Consumables includes the following subcategories, with
any special rules appearing at the start of the section.

* Ammunition begins on this page.
* Oils appear on page 561.
* Potions are described on page 562.
* Scrolls are listed on page 564.
* Talismans begin on page 565.
* Other Consumables begins on page 570.


.. rst-class:: craft-treasure-ammunition

Ammunition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These magic items are ammunition for ranged weapons.
Each item’s stat block includes an Ammunition entry that
lists which type of ammunition it can be Crafted as, or
“any” if it’s not limited to any particular type. All stat
blocks for ammunition omit the Usage and Bulk entries; use
the standard rules in Chapter 6: Equipment for the type of
ammunition to determine reloading times and Bulk.

When using magic ammunition, use your ranged
weapon’s fundamental runes to determine the attack
modifier and damage dice. Don’t add the effects of your
weapon’s property runes unless the ammunition states
otherwise—the ammunition creates its own effects. Magic
ammunition deals damage on a hit normally in addition
to any listed effects unless its description states otherwise.

Regardless of whether an attack with magic ammunition
hits or misses, launching the ammunition consumes its
magic. Magic ammunition is made of normal materials,
not precious materials, unless stated otherwise.

Activated Ammunition
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If magic ammunition doesn’t have an Activate entry, it’s
activated automatically when it’s launched. Types of magic
ammunition that have an Activate entry must be activated
with additional actions before being used. Once you activate
the ammunition, you must shoot it before the end of your
turn. Otherwise, it deactivates (but it isn’t consumed) and
you must activate it again before you can use it. If you shoot
the ammunition without activating it first, it functions as
non-magical ammunition and is still consumed.

The action required to activate the ammunition doesn’t
alter how many actions it takes to reload. For example,
you could activate a beacon shot arrow by touching it with
1 action, then draw and shoot the arrow as part of a Strike
as normal. For a beacon shot bolt, you could activate it,
load it into a crossbow, then shoot it, or load it into the
crossbow, then activate it, and then shoot it.


Beacon Shot / Item 3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Consumable
- Evocation
- Magical

**Price** 10 gp

**Ammunition** arrow, bolt

**Activate** |д-1| Interact

-----------------

The shaft of a beacon shot is studded with tiny flecks of
glimmering gemstones. When an activated beacon shot hits a
target, it embeds itself into that target and spews sparks for
1 minute. If the target is invisible, it becomes merely hidden
to creatures who would otherwise be unable to see it. The
sparks also negate the concealed condition if the target was
otherwise concealed.

A creature can remove the arrow or bolt by using an Interact
basic action and succeeding at a DC 20 Athletics check.



Climbing Bolt /  Item 4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Conjuration
- Consumable
- Magical

**Price** 15 gp

**Ammunition** bolt

-----------------

The shaft of this bolt is wrapped with fine twine. When the
bolt strikes a solid surface, the twine unwinds and enlarges
into a 50-foot-long rope, securely fastened to the surface the
bolt struck. The rope can be pulled free with an Interact action
and a successful DC 20 Athletics check.


Disintegration Bolt /  Item 15
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- :uncommon:`Uncommon`
- Consumable
- Evocation
- Magical

**Price** 1,300 gp

**Ammunition** bolt

**Activate** |д-1| Interact

-----------------

The shaft of this bolt is scorched and blackened, and handling
it coats your fingers with a fine black powder. When an
activated disintegration bolt hits a target, it is subject to a
disintegrate spell requiring a DC 34 Fortitude save. As with
the spell, a critical hit on the attack roll causes the target’s
saving throw outcome to be one degree worse.

-----------------

**Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of disintegrate.





< ... >




.. rst-class:: craft-treasure-oils

Oils
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Oils are magical gels, ointments, pastes, or salves that
are typically applied to an object and are used up in the
process. They have the oil trait. Applying an oil usually
takes two hands: one to hold the jar containing the oil,
and another to extract the oil and apply it. You can
only apply an oil to an item or creature within your
reach. Because the process is so thorough, it is usually
impossible to apply an oil to an unwilling target or an
item in the possession of an unwilling target unless that
target is paralyzed, petrified, or unconscious.



Antimagic Oil / Item 20
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

- :rare:`Rare`
- Abjuration
- Consumable
- Magical
- Oil

**Price** 13,000 gp

**Usage** held in 2 hands; Bulk L

**Activate** |д-1| Interact

------------------

This oil contains energy that repels nearly all types of magic.
When you apply this oil to armor, the creature wearing the
armor becomes immune to all spells, effects of magic items
(the wearer’s and those of others), and effects with the magical
trait for 1 minute. The oil affects neither the magic of the armor
nor the fundamental runes of weapons attacking the wearer.
Magical effects from a source of 20th level or higher, such as a
deity, still function on the armor’s wearer.



Aligned Oil /consumable
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Divine
- Evocation

**Price** 140 gp

**Usage** held in 2 hands; Bulk L

**Activate** |д-1| Interact

------------------

This oil fills a weapon with cosmic power of an alignment. Each
aligned oil is crafted to one alignment: chaos, evil, good, or law
(such as a good-aligned oil). A weapon anointed with this oil
gains the effects of the property rune matching its alignment:
anarchic (chaos), axiomatic (law), holy (good), or unholy (evil).
This lasts for 1 minute.




< ... >






.. rst-class:: craft-treasure-potions

Oils
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A potion is a magical liquid activated when you drink it,
which uses it up. Potions have the potion trait. You can
activate a potion with an Interact action as you drink it
or feed it to another creature. You can feed a potion only
to a creature that is within reach and willing or otherwise
so helpless that it can’t resist. You usually need only one
hand to consume a potion or feed it to another creature.


Barkskin Potion / Item 4
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Abjuration
- Consumable
- Potion
- Primal

**Price** 15 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L

**Activate** |д-1| Interact

------------------

After you drink this bitter draft, your skin thickens like
bark. You gain the effects of a 2nd-level barkskin spell for
10 minutes.


< ... >



Invisibility Potion / Item 4
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- :uncommon:`Uncommon`
- Consumable
- Illusion
- Magical
- Potion

**Price** 20 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L

**Activate** |д-1| Interact

------------------

An invisibility potion is colorless and oddly lightweight. Upon
drinking it, you gain the effects of a 2nd-level invisibility spell.



Panacea / Item 13
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- :uncommon:`Uncommon`
- Consumable
- Healing
- Magical
- Necromancy
- Potion

**Price** 450 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L

**Activate** |д-1| Interact

------------------

This potion appears to shift colors, and no two observers
describe it in the same way. When consumed, it attempts to
counteract all curses and diseases affecting you, as well as
the blinded and deafened conditions from spells affecting you.
The potion has a counteract level of 7 and a +20 modifier for
the roll.






< ... >






.. rst-class:: craft-treasure-scrolls

Scrolls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A scroll contains a single spell that you can cast without
having to expend a spell slot. A scroll can be Crafted to
contain nearly any spell, so the types of scrolls available
are limited only by the number of spells in the game. The
exceptions are cantrips, focus spells, and rituals, none of
which can be put on scrolls. The spell on a scroll can
be cast only once, and the scroll is destroyed as part of
the casting. The spell on the scroll is cast at a particular
spell level, as determined by the scroll. For instance, a
scroll of magic missile (1st level) can be used to cast the
1st-level version of magic missile, but not a magic missile
heightened to 2nd level. If no level is listed, the scroll can
be used to cast the spell at its lowest level.

If you find a scroll, you can try to figure out what spell
it contains. If the spell is a common spell from your spell
list or a spell you know, you can spend a single Recall
Knowledge action and automatically succeed at identifying
the scroll’s spell. If it’s not, you must use Identify Magic
(page 238) to learn what spell the scroll holds.

Casting a Spell from a Scroll
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Casting a Spell from a scroll requires holding the scroll
in one hand and activating it with a Cast a Spell activity
using the normal number of actions for that spell.
To Cast a Spell from a scroll, the spell must appear on
your spell list. Because you’re the one Casting the Spell,
use your spell attack roll and spell DC. The spell also
gains the appropriate trait for your tradition (arcane,
divine, occult, or primal).
Any physical material components and costs are
provided when a scroll is created, so you don’t need to
provide them when Casting a Spell from a scroll. You
must replace any required material component for that
spell with a somatic component. If the spell requires a
focus, you must have that focus to Cast the Spell from
a scroll.

.. rst-class:: craft-treasure-talismans

Talismans
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An item with the talisman trait is a magical charm, gem,
stone, or other small object affixed to armor, a shield, or
a weapon (called the affixed item). Each talisman holds a
sliver of combat knowledge or magical energy that can be
unleashed for a momentary boost of power or enhanced
ability. Many talismans can be activated as a free action
when you use a particular action or activity. A talisman is
a consumable item and has the talisman trait.

You must be wielding or wearing an item to activate a
talisman attached to it. Once activated, a talisman burns
out permanently, usually crumbling into a fine dust.


Affixing a Talisman
""""""""""""""""""""""

Each talisman’s stat block indicates the type of item it
can be affixed to. Affixing or removing requires using
the Affix a Talisman activity. A single talisman can be
affixed to only one item at a time, and an
item can have only one talisman affixed to
it at a time.


Affix A Talisman
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Exploration
- Manipulate

Requirements You must use a repair kit (page
291).

-------------

You spend 10 minutes affixing a talisman to an
item, placing the item on a stable surface and
using the repair kit with both hands. You can
also use this activity to remove a talisman. If
more than one talisman is affixed to an item,
the talismans are suppressed; none of them
can be activated.



Talismans
""""""""""""""""""""""

These are but a few of the talismans available.


Bloodseeker Beak / Item 4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Consumable
- Magical

----------------

This long, hollow proboscis is harvested from the notorious
bloodseeker beast and drips a trickle of blood. When you
activate the beak, you deal an extra 1d4 precision damage
on your damage roll. If you deal sneak attack damage to the
creature, you also deal 1d4 persistent bleed damage.


< ... >


Mending Lattice / Item 13
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

octagon. When you activate it, it negates the damage and
instantly and completely repairs the affixed item.

.. rst-class:: craft-treasure-other-cons

Other Consumables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Though many consumables are grouped into
specific categories, such as potions and talismans, some
consumables don’t fit into those categories.



Candle Of Truth / Item 8
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- :uncommon:`Uncommon`
- Consumable
- Enchantment
- Magical
- Mental


**Price** 75 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; Bulk —

**Activate** |д-1| Interact

---------------

This tapered candle has a golden wick that burns with white fire.
You **activate** the candle by lighting it, which causes creatures
within 10 feet of the candle to find it difficult to tell falsehoods.
Creatures in the area receive a –4 status penalty to Lie.

In addition, when first entering the affected area, each
creature (including you) must succeed at a DC 26 Will save or
be unable to tell any deliberate lies while within 10 feet of the
lit candle. This lasts for as long as the candle is lit. Once lit, the
candle burns for 10 minutes, and it cannot be extinguished.



Dust Of Appearance / Item 6
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Consumable
- Divination
- Magical

**Price** 50 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; Bulk —

**Activate** |д-1| Interact

---------------

Stored in a small reed, this powder looks like a fine metallic
dust. When you fling it in the air, it coats all creatures in a
10-foot burst centered on a point within 5 feet of you. For 1
minute, the coated creatures can’t be concealed or invisible,
nor can they benefit from mirror image or similar abilities
that create illusory duplicates. Any illusions in the area of
3rd level or lower are revealed as such, although this does
not end their effect.





< ... >




.. rst-class:: craft-treasure-held-items

Held Items
-----------------------------------------

These items need to be held to use them. Weapons, wands,
and staves follow special rules and have their own sections.

Bag Of Holding / Item 4+
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Conjuration
- Extradimensional
- Magical

**Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** 1

---------------------

Though it appears to be a cloth sack decorated with panels
of richly colored silk or stylish embroidery, a bag of holding
opens into an extradimensional space larger than its outside
dimensions. The Bulk held inside the bag doesn’t change the
Bulk of the bag of holding itself. The amount of Bulk the bag’s
extradimensional space can hold depends on its type.

You can Interact with the bag of holding to put items in or
remove them just like a mundane sack. Though the bag can
hold a great amount of material, an object still needs to be able
to fit through the opening of the sack to be stored inside.

If the bag is overloaded or broken, it ruptures and is
ruined, causing the items inside to be lost forever. If it’s
turned inside out, the items inside spill out unharmed,
but the bag must be put right before
it can be used again. A living creature
placed inside the bag has enough air for
10 minutes before it begins to suffocate,
and it can attempt to Escape against a DC of 13. An
item inside the bag provides no benefits unless it’s
retrieved first. An item in the bag can’t be detected
by magic that detects only things on the same plane.

---------------------

**Type** I; **Level** 4; **Price** 75 gp; **Capacity** 25 Bulk

**Type** II; **Level** 7; **Price** 300 gp; **Capacity** 50 Bulk

**Type** III; **Level** 11; **Price** 1,200 gp; **Capacity** 100 Bulk

**Type** IV; **Level** 13; **Price** 2,400 gp; **Capacity** 150 Bulk





< ... >










.. rst-class:: craft-treasure-materials

Materials
-----------------------------------------

Most items are made from readily available materials—
usually leather, wood, or steel—but some weapons and
armor are made from more exotic materials, giving
them unique properties and other advantages. Weapons
made from precious materials are better able to harm
certain creatures, and armor of these materials provides
enhanced protection.

< ... >

Precious Materials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Materials with the precious trait can be substituted for
base materials. For example, a hammer’s head could be
made of adamantine instead of iron. Items made of a
precious material cost more than typical items; not only
does precious material cost more, but the crafter must
invest more time working with it. In addition, more
powerful items require precious materials of greater purity.

A number of precious materials are described below. The
Price entry for each material gives the Price of a simple
non-magical item made of that material, based on its Bulk
(if the item is lighter than 1 Bulk, use the price for 1 Bulk),
as well as Prices for different amounts of the material itself.
Prices for armor, shields, and weapons made of precious
material are in the Armor (page 555), Shields (page 586),
and Weapons (page 599) sections of this chapter.


Crafting with Precious Materials
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Only an expert crafter can create a low-grade item, only
a master can create a standard-grade item, and only a
legendary crafter can create a high-grade item. In addition,
to Craft with a precious material, your character level
must be equal to or greater than that of the material.



Adamantine / Material 8+
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- :uncommon:`Uncommon`
- Precious

Mined from rocks that fell from the heavens, adamantine is one
of the hardest metals known. It has a shiny, black appearance,
and it is prized for its amazing resiliency and ability to hold an
incredibly sharp edge.

----------------

**Type** adamantine chunk; **Price** 500 gp; Bulk L

**Type** adamantine ingot; **Price** 5,000 gp; Bulk 1

**Type** standard-grade adamantine object; **Level** 8; **Price** 350 gp
per Bulk

**Type** high-grade adamantine object; **Level** 16; **Price** 6,000 gp
per Bulk

< ... >










.. rst-class:: craft-treasure-runes

Runes
-----------------------------------------

Most magic weapons and armor gain their enhancements
from potent eldritch runes etched into them. These runes
allow for in-depth customization of items.

< ... >


Fundamental Runes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Four fundamental runes produce the most essential magic
of protection and destruction: armor potency and resilient
runes for armor, and weapon potency and striking runes for
weapons. A potency rune is what makes a weapon a magic
weapon (page 599) or armor magic armor (page 556).


Fundamental Armor Runes
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

ARMOR POTENCY / RUNE 5+
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Abjuration
- Magical

Usage etched onto armor

-------------

Magic wards deflect attacks. Increase the armor’s item bonus
to AC by 1. The armor can be etched with one property rune.
You can upgrade the armor potency rune already etched
on a suit of armor to a stronger version, increasing the
values of the existing rune to those of the new rune. You
must have the formula of the stronger rune to do so, and
the Price of the upgrade is the difference between the two
runes’ Prices.

-------------

**Type** +1 armor potency; **Level** 5; **Price** 160 gp;
**Craft Requirements** You are an expert in Crafting.

-------------

**Type** +2 armor potency; **Level** 11; **Price** 1,060 gp;
**Craft Requirements** You are a master in Crafting.

Increase the armor’s item bonus to AC by 2, and the armor can
be etched with two property runes.

-------------

**Type** +3 armor potency; **Level** 18; **Price** 20,560 gp;
**Craft Requirements** You are legendary in Crafting.

Increase the armor’s item bonus to AC by 3, and the armor can
be etched with three property runes.

< ... >

Property Runes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Property runes add special abilities to armor or a weapon
in addition to the item’s fundamental runes. If a suit of
armor or a weapon has multiple etchings of the same
rune, only the highest-level one applies. You can upgrade
a property rune to a higher-level type of that rune in the
same way you would upgrade a fundamental rune.

Rune abilities that must be activated follow the rules
for activating magic items on page 532.


Armor Property Runes
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Antimagic / Rune 15
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- :uncommon:`Uncommon`
- Abjuration
- Magical

**Price** 6,500 gp

**Usage** etched onto armor

-----------------

This intricate rune displaces spell energy, granting you a +1
status bonus to saving throws against magical effects.

**Activate** |д-р| command;
**Frequency** once per day;
**Trigger** A spell targets you or includes you in its area;
**Effect** The armor attempts to counteract the triggering spell with the effect of
a 7th-level dispel magic spell and a counteract modifier of +26.

-----------------

**Craft Requirements** Supply one casting of dispel magic.







.. rst-class:: craft-treasure-shields

Shields
--------------------------------------------

All magic shields are specific items with a wide variety
of protective effects, as described in their entries. Unlike
magic armor, magic shields can’t be etched with runes.


Precious Material Shields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shields made of precious materials are more expensive
and have different durabilities. You can make bucklers
and most shields out of any of these precious materials,
but only darkwood can be used to make tower shields.


Adamantine Shield / Item 8+
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- :uncommon:`Uncommon`

**Usage** varies by shield

Adamantine shields are particularly sturdy, and when used for
a shield bash, they are adamantine weapons.

---------------

**Type** standard-grade adamantine buckler; **Level** 8; **Price** 400 gp;
**Bulk** L; **Craft Requirements** adamantine worth at least 50 gp

The shield has Hardness 8, HP 32, and BT 16.

The shield has Hardness 13, HP 52, and BT 26.













< ... >










.. rst-class:: craft-treasure-snares

Snares
-----------------------------------------------

Snares are small annoyances and simple traps you can
create using the Crafting skill if you have the Snare
Crafting feat (page 266). Creating a snare requires a
snare kit (page 291) and an amount of raw materials
worth the amount listed in the snare’s Price entry. Unlike
other items, found snares cannot be collected or sold in
their complete form. Snares have the snare trait.

< ... >

Disabling Snares
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once a creature discovers a snare, it can disable it much like
it can other physical traps, using the Disable a Device action
of the Thievery skill and using the Crafting DC of the snare’s
creator as the DC. As you become better at creating snares,
your snares become harder to disable by those with lesser
ability. If you are an expert in Crafting, only a creature that
is trained in Thievery can disable them; if you are a master
in Crafting, only a creature that is an expert in Thievery can
disable them; and if you are legendary in Crafting, only a
creature that is a master in Thievery can disable them.

You can automatically disarm a snare that you
personally Crafted without triggering it by spending an
Interact action while adjacent to the snare.


Alarm Snare / Snare 1
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Auditory
- Consumable
- Mechanical
- Snare
- Trap

**Price** 3 gp

--------------

You create an alarm snare by rigging one or more noisy
objects to a trip wire or pressure plate. When you create an
alarm snare, you designate a range between 100 to 500 feet
at which it can be heard. When a Small or larger creature
enters the square, the snare makes a noise loud enough that
it can be heard by all creatures in the range you designated.











< ... >










.. rst-class:: craft-treasure-staves

Staves
-----------------------------------------

< ... >


Attacking with a Staff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Staves are also staff weapons (page 280), included in their
Price. They can be etched with runes as normal for a staff.
This doesn’t alter any of their spellcasting abilities.


.. rst-class:: craft-treasure-staves-list

List of staves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Animal Staff / Item 4+
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Divination
- Magical
- Staff

.. rst-class:: craft-treasure-structures

Structures
-------------------------------------------

These items create structures of significant size, typically
by growing from their more manageable, normal forms.
All these items have the structure trait, described in the
sidebar below.


Explorer's Yurt / Item 10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Conjuration
- Magical
- Structure

**Price** 880 gp

**Bulk** 1 (when not activated)

------------------

Before activation, this item appears to be nothing more than a
simple rolled-up tent, barely large enough to fit four Medium
creatures. Despite attempts to clean it, the tent is perpetually
smudged with dirt in various places.

**Activate** (10 minutes) Interact; **Frequency** once per
day; **Effect** The rolled-up tent expands into a spacious yurt
complete with a fire pit, 10 bedrolls, various cooking utensils,
and basic food and water.

The yurt can house and feed you and up to nine other
Medium creatures that eat roughly as much as a human does;
they need not attempt a Survival check to Subsist when you
use the yurt. Fires and light inside the yurt do not extend
illumination into the area surrounding the yurt, making it
harder to spot from a distance.

A large loop of red cloth hangs from one wall. If this loop
is pulled, which takes an Interact action, the entire yurt
immediately folds back up into its deactivated form, ready for
further travel.













< ... >












Wands
-----------------------------------------

< ... >




.. rst-class:: craft-treasure-wands

Magic Wand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest form of wand contains a spell, with Price
and level based on that spell. The wand has the magical
and wand traits, as well as the traits the spell has. The
name of a magic wand with a spell in it is simply “wand
of,” followed by the spell’s name.


Magic Wand / Item 3+

.. rst-class:: craft-treasure-weapons

Weapons
---------------------------------------------

Weapons can be crafted from precious materials or infused
with magic to grant them powerful and unusual abilities.


Precious Material Weapons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Weapons made of precious materials are more expensive
and sometimes have special effects. You can make metal
weapons out of any of these materials except darkwood,
and wooden weapons out of darkwood. To determine the
Price of 10 pieces of ammunition, use the base Price for a
single weapon, without adding any extra for Bulk.


Adamantine Weapon / Item 11+
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- :uncommon:`Uncommon`


**Usage** varies by weapon; **Bulk** varies by weapon

------------

Adamantine weapons have a shiny black
appearance and cut through lesser items with
ease. They treat any object they hit as if it had half as
much Hardness as usual, unless the object’s Hardness
is greater than that of the adamantine weapon.

.. rst-class:: craft-treasure-worn-items

Worn Items
-----------------------------------------

This section includes magic items you wear. Most have the
invested trait, which means you can wear no more than 10
(page 531). Worn items include the following subcategories,
with special rules appearing at the start of the section.

* Apex Items on this page.
* Companion Items on page 604.
* Other Worn Items on page 604.


Apex Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you Invest an Item that has the
apex trait, it improves one of your ability
scores, either increasing it by 2 or to a total of 18,
whichever grants the higher score. This gives you all the
benefits of the new ability score until the investiture runs
out: increasing Intelligence lets you become trained in an
additional skill and learn a new language,
increasing Constitution gives you more
Hit Points, and so on.

An apex item grants this benefit only
the first time it’s invested within a 24-hour
period, and you can benefit from only one
apex item at a time. If you attempt to invest an apex item
when you already have one invested, you don’t
gain the ability score increase, though you
do gain any other effects of Investing
the Item.



List of Items
"""""""""""""""""""""


Anklets Of Alacrity / Item 17
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Apex
- Invested
- Magical
- Transmutation

**Price** 15,000 gp

**Usage** worn anklets; **Bulk** —

-----------------

These gem-studded golden anklets give you a +3
item bonus to Acrobatics checks. When you invest the anklets,
you either increase your Dexterity score by 2 or increase it to
18, whichever would give you a higher score.

-----------------

**Activate** |д-1| Interact;
**Frequency** once per day;
**Effect** You click the anklets together, gaining a +20-foot status
bonus to all your Speeds and the effects of
water walk for the next 10 minutes.

< ... >

Companion Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might want to acquire items that benefit an animal
or beast that assists you. These items have the companion
trait, meaning they function only for animal companions,
familiars, and similar creatures. If it’s unclear whether a
creature can benefit from such an item, the GM decides.

Investing Companion Items
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Any worn companion item needs to be invested. However,
your companion needs to invest it rather than you
doing so. This requires you to use the Invest an Item
activity alongside your companion. A companion has an
investiture limit of two items (instead of the 10-item limit
a player character has).


Barding Of The Zephyr / Item 10
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Companion
- invested
- primal
- transmutation

**Price** 900 gp

**Usage** worn barding; **Bulk** L

-----------------

This light barding is covered in stylized wind motifs. When
you suit up your animal companion, the barding adjusts to fit
your animal companion regardless of its shape.

When your companion falls, wind picks it up from below; it
gains the effects of feather fall.

**Activate** [two-actions] Interact;
**Frequency** once per day;
**Effect** You trace a finger along the wind motifs on the barding, granting
your companion wearing the barding a fly Speed of 30 feet
for 10 minutes. Even if the companion doesn’t have the mount
special ability, it can still Fly while being ridden.

Aeon Stone / Item 1+
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- :uncommon:`Uncommon`
- Invested
- Magical
- Transmutation

**Usage** worn; **Bulk** —

-------------------

Over millennia, these mysterious, intricately cut gemstones
have been hoarded by mystics and fanatics hoping to
discover their secrets. Despite their myriad forms and
functions, these stones are purportedly all fragments of
crystal tools used by otherworldly entities to construct the
universe in primeval times.

When you invest one of these precisely shaped crystals, the
stone orbits your head instead of being worn on your body.
You can stow an aeon stone with an Interact action, and an
orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful
Disarm action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains
invested, but its effects are suppressed until you return it to
orbit your head again.

There are various types of aeon stones, each with
a different shape, color, and magical effect. Each
aeon stone also gains a resonant power when
slotted into a special magical item called a
wayfinder (page 617).

-------------------

**Type** clear spindle;
**Level** 7;
**Price** 325 gp

You don’t need to eat or drink while this aeon
stone is invested by you. This aeon stone doesn’t

primal innate spell once per day.

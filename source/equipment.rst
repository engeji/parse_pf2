   *To make your mark on the world, you’ll need to have the right equipment, including
   armor, weapons, and other gear. This chapter presents the various equipment that you can
   purchase during character creation. You can usually find these items for sale in most cities
   and other large settlements.*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Coins and Currency
====================

Though you might be able to barter valuable items in
some areas, currency is the most versatile way to make
transactions when you head to market. The most common
currency is coins. For most commoners and beginning
adventurers, the standard unit is the silver piece (sp). Each
silver piece is a standard weight of silver and is typically
accepted by any merchant or kingdom no matter where
it was minted. There are three other common types of
coins, each likewise standardized in weight and value. The
first is the copper piece (cp). Each copper piece is worth
one‐tenth of a silver piece. The gold piece (gp) is often used
for purchasing magic items and other expensive items, as
1 gold piece is worth 10 silver pieces or 100 copper pieces.
The platinum piece (pp) is used by nobles to demonstrate
their wealth, for the purchase of very expensive items, or
simply as a way to easily transport large sums of currency.
A platinum piece is worth 10 gold pieces, 100 silver pieces,
or 1,000 copper pieces. See Table 6–1: Coin Values for the
exchange rates of common types of coins.


Other Currency
------------------

Art objects, gems, and raw materials (such as those used
for the Craft activity) can be used much like currency:
you can sell them for the same Price you can buy them.

Carrying and Using Items
=========================

A character typically has two hands, allowing them to hold
an item in each hand or a single two-handed item using
both hands. Drawing or changing how you’re carrying an
item usually requires you to use an Interact action (though
to drop an item, you use the Release action instead).
Table 6–2: Changing Equipment on page 273 lists some
ways that you might change the items you’re holding or
carrying, and the number of hands you need to do so.
Many ways of using items require you to spend
multiple actions. For example, drinking a potion stowed in
your belt pouch requires using an Interact action to draw
it and then using a second action to drink it as described in
its Activate entry (page 532).


Bulk
------------------

Carrying especially heavy or unwieldy items can make
it more difficult for you to move, as can overloading
yourself with too much gear. The Bulk value of an item
reflects how difficult the item is to handle, representing its
size, weight, and general awkwardness. If you have a high
Strength score, you usually don’t need to worry about
Bulk unless you’re carrying numerous substantial items.

Bulk Limits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can carry an amount of Bulk equal to 5 plus your
Strength modifier without penalty; if you carry more, you
gain the encumbered condition. You can’t hold or carry
more Bulk than 10 plus your Strength modifier.


Bulk Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Items can have a number to indicate their Bulk value,
or they can be light (indicated by an L) or negligible
(indicated by a —) for the purpose of determining Bulk.
For instance, full plate armor is 4 Bulk, a longsword is
1 Bulk, a dagger or scroll is light, and a piece of chalk is
negligible. Ten light items count as 1 Bulk, and you round
down fractions (so 9 light items count as 0 Bulk, and 11
light items count as 1 Bulk). Items of negligible Bulk don’t
count toward Bulk unless you try to carry vast numbers
of them, as determined by the GM.

Armor
======================

.. epigraph::

   *Armor increases your character’s defenses, but some medium or heavy armor can hamper
   movement. If you want to increase your character’s defense beyond the protection your armor
   provides, they can use a shield. Armor protects your character only while they’re wearing it.*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Armor Class
--------------

Your Armor Class (AC) measures how well you can
defend against attacks. When a creature attacks you, your
Armor Class is the DC for that attack roll.
Armor Class = 10 + Dexterity modifier (up to your
armor’s Dex Cap) + proficiency bonus + armor’s
item bonus to AC + other bonuses + penalties
Use your proficiency bonus for the category (light,
medium, or heavy) or the specific type of armor you’re
wearing. If you’re not wearing armor, use your proficiency
in unarmored defense.


Donning and Removing Armor
----------------------------

Getting in and out of armor is time consuming—so
make sure you’re wearing it when you need it! Donning
and removing armor are both activities involving many
Interact actions. It takes 1 minute to don light armor, 5
minutes to don medium or heavy armor, and 1 minute to
remove any armor.


Armor Statistics
---------------------

Table 6–3: Unarmored Defense provides the statistics
for the various forms of protection without wearing
armor. Table 6–4: Armor provides the statistics for suits
of armor that can be purchased and worn, organized
by category. The columns in both tables provide the
following statistics.

Category
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The armor’s category—unarmored, light armor, medium
armor, or heavy armor—indicates which proficiency
bonus you use while wearing the armor.

AC Bonus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This number is the item bonus you add for the armor
when determining Armor Class.

Dexterity Modifier Cap (Dex Cap)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This number is the maximum amount of your
Dexterity modifier that can apply to your AC while you
are wearing a given suit of armor. For example, if you
have a Dexterity modifier of +4 and you are wearing
a suit of half plate, you apply only a +1 bonus from
your Dexterity modifier to your AC while wearing
that armor.

Shields
=================

.. epigraph::
	
	*A shield can increase your character’s defense beyond the protection their armor provides.
	Your character must be wielding a shield in one hand to make use of it, and it grants its
	bonus to AC only if they use an action to Raise a Shield. This action grants the shield’s bonus
	to AC as a circumstance bonus until their next turn starts. A shield’s Speed penalty applies
	whenever your character is holding the shield, whether they have raised it or not.*

--------------------------------------------


Raise a Shield is the action most commonly used with
shields. Most shields must be held in one hand, so you
can’t hold anything with that hand and Raise a Shield. A
buckler, however, doesn’t take up your hand, so you can
Raise a Shield with a buckler if the hand is free (or, at
the GM’s discretion, if it’s holding a simple, lightweight
object that’s not a weapon). You lose the benefits of Raise
a Shield if that hand is no longer free.

When you have a tower shield raised, you can use the
Take Cover action (page 471) to increase the circumstance
bonus to AC to +4. This lasts until the shield is no longer
raised. If you would normally provide lesser cover against
an attack, having your tower shield raised provides
standard cover against it (and other creatures can Take
Cover as normal using the cover from your shield).

If you have access to the Shield Block reaction (from
your class or from a feat), you can use it while Raising
your Shield to reduce the damage you take by an amount
equal to the shield’s Hardness. Both you and the shield
then take any remaining damage.


Shield Statistics
--------------------

Shields have statistics that follow the same rules as armor:
Price, Speed Penalty, and Bulk. See page 274 for the rules
for those statistics. Their other statistics are described here.

AC Bonus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A shield grants a circumstance bonus to AC, but only
when the shield is raised. This requires using the Raise a
Shield action, found on page 472.

Hardness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever a shield takes damage, the amount of damage it
takes is reduced by this amount. This number is particularly
relevant for shields because of the Shield Block feat
(page 266). The rules for Hardness appear on page 272.

HP (BT)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This column lists the shield’s Hit Points (HP) and Broken
Threshold (BT). These measure how much damage the
shield can take before it’s destroyed (its total HP) and how
much it can take before being broken and unusable (its BT).
These matter primarily for the Shield Block reaction.


Attacking with a Shield
--------------------------

A shield can be used as a martial weapon for attacks,
using the statistics listed for a shield bash on Table 6–7:
Melee Weapons (page 280). The shield bash is an option
only for shields that weren’t designed to be used as
weapons. A shield can’t have runes added to it. You can
also buy and attach a shield boss or shield spikes to a
shield to make it a more practical weapon. These can be
found on Table 6–7. These work like other weapons and
can even be etched with runes.


Shield Descriptions
---------------------

Each type of shield is described in more detail below.

**Buckler**: This very small shield is a favorite of duelists
and quick, lightly armored warriors. It’s typically made of
steel and strapped to your forearm. You can Raise a Shield
with your buckler as long as you have that hand free or
are holding a light object that’s not a weapon in that hand.

**Wooden Shield**: Though they come in a variety of shapes
and sizes, the protection offered by wooden shields comes
from the stoutness of their materials. While wooden shields
are less expensive than steel shields, they break more easily.

**Steel Shield**: Like wooden shields, steel shields come
in a variety of shapes and sizes. Though more expensive
than wooden shields, they are much more durable.

**Tower Shield**: These massive shields can be used to
provide cover to nearly the entire body. Due to their size,
they are typically made of wood reinforced with metal.

Weapons
===================================

.. epigraph::
	
	*Most characters in Pathfinder carry weapons, ranging from mighty warhammers to graceful
	bows to even simple clubs. Full details on how you calculate the bonuses, modifiers, and
	penalties for attack rolls and damage rolls are given in Chapter 9 on page 446, but they’re
	summarized here, followed by the rules for weapons and dozens of weapon choices.*

--------------------------------------------


Attack Rolls
--------------------------

When making an attack roll, determine the result by
rolling 1d20 and adding your attack modifier for the
weapon or unarmed attack you’re using. Modifiers for
melee and ranged attacks are calculated differently.

Multiple Attack Penalty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use an action with the attack trait more than once
on the same turn, your attacks after the first take a penalty
called a multiple attack penalty. Your second attack takes a
–5 penalty, and any subsequent attacks take a –10 penalty.
The multiple attack penalty doesn’t apply to attacks
you make when it isn’t your turn (such as attacks made as
part of a reaction). You can use a weapon with the agile
trait (page 282) to reduce your multiple attack penalty.


Damage Rolls
----------------------

When the result of your attack roll with a weapon or
unarmed attack equals or exceeds your target’s AC, you
hit your target! Roll the weapon or unarmed attack’s
damage die and add the relevant modifiers, bonuses, and
penalties to determine the amount of damage you deal.
Calculate a damage roll as follows.


Critical Hits
-----------------------

When you make an attack and roll a natural 20 (the
number on the die is 20), or if the result of your attack
exceeds the target’s AC by 10, you achieve a critical
success (also known as a critical hit).
If you critically succeed at a Strike, your attack deals
double damage (page 451). Other attacks, such as spell
attack rolls and some uses of the Athletics skill, describe
the specific effects that occur when their outcomes are
critical successes.




< ... >





Weapon Statistics
-----------------------


The tables on pages 280–282 list the statistics for various
melee and ranged weapons that you can purchase, as well
as the statistics for striking with a fist (or another basic
unarmed attack). The tables present the following statistics.
All weapons listed in this chapter have an item level of 0.

Damage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This entry lists the weapon’s damage die and the type of
damage it deals: B for bludgeoning, P for piercing, or S
for slashing.

.. rst-class:: equip-subchap

Gear
=================

.. epigraph::
	
	*Your character needs all sorts of items both while exploring and in downtime, ranging
	from rations to climbing gear to fancy clothing, depending on the situation.*

--------------------------------------------


Gear Statistics
---------------------

Tables 6–9 and 6–10 list Price and Bulk entries for a
wide variety of gear. Any item with a number after it
in parentheses indicates that the item’s Price is for the
indicated quantity, though the Bulk entry for such an
item is the value for only one such item. All items in this
chapter are level 0 unless the item name is followed by a
higher item level in parentheses.


Hands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This lists how many hands it takes to use
the item effectively. Most items that require
two hands can be carried in only one hand,
but you must spend an Interact action
to change your grip in order to use
the item. The GM may determine
that an item is too big to carry in one hand (or
even two hands, for particularly large items).


Adventuring Gear
---------------------
These items follow special rules or require more detail.

**Adventurer’s Pack**: This item is the starter kit for an
adventurer, containing the essential items for exploration
and survival. The Bulk value is for the entire pack together,
but see the descriptions of individual items as necessary.
The pack contains the following items: backpack
(containing the other goods), bedroll, two belt pouches,
10 pieces of chalk, flint and steel, 50 feet of rope, 2 weeks’
rations, soap, 5 torches, and a waterskin.

Class Kits

Alchemical Gear
----------------------

The items listed on Table 6–11 are the most
widely available alchemical items from
Chapter 11, which a 1st-level character
could likely access. The descriptions
below are incomplete; each item’s full
entry appears in Chapter 11 on the
page listed in the table. Your GM
might allow you to start with other
alchemical items from Chapter 11 on a
case‐by‐case basis.

Alchemical Bombs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alchemical bombs are consumable weapons that deal
damage or produce special effects, and they sometimes
deal splash damage. For more on alchemical bombs, see
page 544.

**Lesser Acid Flask**: This alchemical bomb deals 1
acid damage, 1d6 persistent acid damage, and 1 acid
splash damage.

**Lesser Alchemist’s Fire**: This alchemical
bomb deals 1d8 fire damage, 1 persistent
fire damage, and 1 fire splash damage.

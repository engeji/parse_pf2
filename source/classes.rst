Alchemist
-----------------------

You enjoy tinkering with alchemical formulas and
substances in your spare time, and your studies have
progressed beyond mere experimentation.


Multiclass alchemist characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The free alchemical items from the alchemist archetype
are extremely useful to characters of any class. The
following are just some of the possible combinations.

* Barbarian alchemists can mix mutagens with their rage to ferocious effect.
* Champion alchemists can focus on alchemical items that boost defenses and heal others, allowing their champion’s reaction and lay on hands to go further.
* Fighter alchemists can use their alchemy to gain additional options in situations where their usual tactics don’t work.
* Ranger alchemists focus on alchemy and snares, getting extra use out of their Crafting skill and supplying bombs for the bomb snare.
* Rogue alchemists can combine a rogue’s poison feats with free daily poisons, and bombs present an interesting way to sneak attack with various types of energy damage.
* Spellcaster alchemists often use their alchemical items to take pressure off their repertoire or prepared spells. For instance, a wizard alchemist who can brew up darksight elixirs to grant darkvision can prepare another spell instead of darkvision.

Animal Companions and Familiars
=========================================

< ... >

Animal Companions
--------------------------------

An animal companion is a loyal comrade who follows
your orders without you needing to use Handle an Animal
on it. Your animal companion has the minion trait, and it
gains 2 actions during your turn if you use the Command
an Animal action to command it; this is in place of the
usual effects of Command an Animal. If your companion
dies, you can spend a week of downtime to replace it at no
cost. You can have only one animal companion at a time.

Riding Animal Companions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You or an ally can ride your animal companion as long as
it is at least one size larger than the rider. If it is carrying a
rider, the animal companion can use only its land Speed, and
it can’t move and Support you on the same turn. However, if
your companion has the mount special ability, it’s especially
suited for riding and ignores both of these restrictions.

Young Animal Companions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following are the base statistics for a young animal
companion, the first animal companion most characters
get. You make adjustments to these statistics depending
on the type of animal you choose. As you gain levels,
you might make further adjustments as your companion
becomes more powerful. Animal companions calculate
their modifiers and DCs just as you do with one difference:
the only item bonuses they can benefit from are to speed
and AC (their maximum item bonus to AC is +2).

Proficiencies
"""""""""""""""""""

Your animal companion uses your level to determine its
proficiency bonuses. It’s trained in its unarmed attacks,
unarmored defense, barding, all saving throws, Perception,
Acrobatics, and Athletics. Animal companions can’t use
abilities that require greater Intelligence, such as Coerce
or Decipher Writing, even if trained in the appropriate
skill, unless they have a specialization that allows it.

Ability Modifiers
""""""""""""""""""

An animal companion begins with base ability modifiers
of Str +2, Dex +2, Con +1, Int –4, Wis +1, Cha +0. Each
type has its own strengths and increases two of these
modifiers by 1 each. These increases are already calculated
into the stat blocks in Companion Types below.

Hit Points
"""""""""""""""
Your animal companion has ancestry Hit Points from
its type, plus a number of Hit Points equal to 6 plus its
Constitution modifier for each level you have.


.. _ch3--classes--animal-companions--mature:

Mature Animal Companions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To advance a young animal companion to a mature animal
companion (usually a result of one of your class feat
choices), increase its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and
Wisdom modifiers by 1. Increase its unarmed attack damage
from one die to two dice (for instance 1d8 to 2d8), and its
proficiency rank for Perception and all saving throws to
expert. Increase its proficiency ranks in Intimidation, Stealth,
and Survival to trained, and if it was already trained in one
of those skills from its type, increase its proficiency rank in
that skill to expert. If your companion is Medium or smaller,
it grows by one size.

Nimble Animal Companions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To advance a mature animal companion to a nimble
animal companion, increase its Dexterity modifier by 2
and its Strength, Constitution, and Wisdom modifiers
by 1. It deals 2 additional damage with its unarmed
attacks. Increase its proficiency ranks in Acrobatics and
unarmored defense to expert. It also learns the advanced
maneuver for its type. Its attacks become magical for the
purpose of ignoring resistances.

Savage Animal Companions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To advance a mature animal companion to a savage animal
companion, increase its Strength modifier by 2 and its
Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom modifiers by 1. It deals
3 additional damage with its unarmed attacks. Increase
its proficiency rank in Athletics to expert. It also learns
the advanced maneuver for its type. If your companion is
Medium or smaller, it grows by one size. Its attacks become
magical for the purpose of ignoring resistances.

Companion Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The species of animal you choose is called your companion’s
type. Each companion type has its own statistics. The
Size entry indicates your companion’s starting size as a
young animal companion. Following the size entry are
the companion’s unarmed attacks, and then its ability
modifiers. The Hit Points entry indicates the companion’s
ancestry Hit Points. The Skill entry indicates an additional
trained skill your companion has. The Senses entry lists
your companion’s special senses. The Speed entry gives
your companion’s Speeds. The Special entry, if present, lists
any other special abilities your companion has, for example
whether it often serves as a mount and is particularly
appropriate for mounted classes, such as the champion.
The Support Benefit entry indicates a special benefit you
gain by Commanding the Animal to use the Support action
(see below). The Advanced Maneuver entry indicates a
powerful new action your companion learns how to use if
it becomes a nimble or savage animal companion.

.. rst-class:: description

Support |д-1|
"""""""""""""""

**Requirements** The creature is an animal companion.

----------------------------------------------

Your animal companion supports you. You gain the benefits
listed in the companion type’s Support Benefit entry. If the
animal uses the Support action, the only other actions it can
use on this turn are basic move actions to get into position to
take advantage of the Support benefits; if it has already used
any other action this turn, it can’t Support you.



.. rst-class:: animal

Badger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Your companion is a badger, wolverine, or other big mustelid.

Size Small

Melee |д-1| jaws, Damage 1d8 piercing

Melee |д-1| claw (agile), Damage 1d6 slashing

Str +2, Dex +2, Con +2, Int –4, Wis +2, Cha +0

Hit Points 8

Skill Survival

Senses low-light vision, scent (imprecise, 30 feet)

Speed 25 feet, burrow 10 feet, climb 10 feet

Support Benefit Your badger digs around your foe’s position,
interfering with its footing. Until the start of your next turn, if
you hit and deal damage to a creature your badger threatens,
the target can’t use a Step action (unless it can Step through
difficult terrain) until it moves from its current position.

Advanced Maneuver Badger Rage


Badger Rage |д-1|
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- CONCENTRATE
- EMOTION
- MENTAL

Requirements The badger isn’t fatigued or raging.

--------------------------------

The badger enters a state of pure rage that lasts for 1 minute, until
there are no enemies it can perceive, or until it falls unconscious,
whichever comes first. It can’t voluntarily stop raging. While
raging, the badger is affected in the following ways.

* It deals 4 additional damage with its bite attacks and 2 additional damage with its claw attacks.
* It takes a –1 penalty to AC.
* It can’t use actions that have the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait. The animal companion can Seek even while raging.

After it has stopped raging, it can’t use Badger Rage again
for 1 minute.

Alchemist
-----------------------

You enjoy tinkering with alchemical formulas and
substances in your spare time, and your studies have
progressed beyond mere experimentation.


Multiclass alchemist characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The free alchemical items from the alchemist archetype
are extremely useful to characters of any class. The
following are just some of the possible combinations.

* Barbarian alchemists can mix mutagens with their rage to ferocious effect.
* Champion alchemists can focus on alchemical items that boost defenses and heal others, allowing their champion’s reaction and lay on hands to go further.
* Fighter alchemists can use their alchemy to gain additional options in situations where their usual tactics don’t work.
* Ranger alchemists focus on alchemy and snares, getting extra use out of their Crafting skill and supplying bombs for the bomb snare.
* Rogue alchemists can combine a rogue’s poison feats with free daily poisons, and bombs present an interesting way to sneak attack with various types of energy damage.
* Spellcaster alchemists often use their alchemical items to take pressure off their repertoire or prepared spells. For instance, a wizard alchemist who can brew up darksight elixirs to grant darkvision can prepare another spell instead of darkvision.

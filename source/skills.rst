- Downtime

**Requirements**: You have a spellcasting class feature, and the spell you want to learn is on your magical tradition’s spell list.

------------------------------------------------------------------

job available. You can search for lower-level tasks, with the

Crafting Goods for the Market (Crafting)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using Crafting, you can work at producing common
items for the market. It’s usually easy to find work making
basic items whose level is 1 or 2 below your settlement’s
level (see Earn Income on page 504). Higher-level tasks
represent special commissions, which might require you to
Craft a specific item using the Craft downtime activity and
sell it to a buyer at full price. These opportunities don’t
occur as often and might have special requirements—or
serious consequences if you disappoint a prominent client.

Practicing a Trade (Lore)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You apply the practical benefits of one of your Lore
specialties during downtime by practicing your trade. This
is most effective for Lore specialties such as business, law,
or sailing, where there’s high demand for workers. The GM
might increase the DC or determine only low-level tasks
are available if you’re attempting to use an obscure Lore
skill to Earn Income. You might also need specialized tools
to accept a job, like mining tools to work in a mine or a
merchant’s scale to buy and sell valuables in a market.



Skill Descriptions
----------------------

The following entries describe the skills in the game. The
heading for each entry provides the skill’s name, with
that skill’s key ability in parentheses. A brief description
of the skill is followed by a list of actions you can use if
you’re untrained in that skill, and then the actions you
can perform if you are trained in that skill. Some actions
list sample tasks for each rank to give you a better
sense of what you can accomplish as your proficiency
increases. As the actions of a skill aren’t comprehensive,
there may be times when the GM asks you to attempt
a skill check without using any of the listed actions, or
times when the GM asks you to roll using a different key
ability modifier.
Most skills include entries for success and failure, as
well as descriptions of what occurs on a critical success or
a critical failure. If either of the critical entries is absent,
treat those results as a success or failure, as normal.

.. epigraph::
	
	*Backgrounds allow you to customize your character based on their life before adventuring. 
	This is the next step in their life story after their ancestry, which reflects the circumstances 
	of their birth. Your character’s background can help you learn or portray more about their 
	personality while also suggesting what sorts of things they’re likely to know. Consider 
	what events set your character on their path to the life of an adventurer and how those 
	circumstances relate to their background.*
